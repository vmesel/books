# Jeff Bezos - Invent & Wander

- Regret Minimization framework - a framework developed to decrease the amount of regret involved on a decision (think that you are 80 years old and think you regret of trying this thing/moment/opportunity)
- The discipline of writing a (business) plan gets you to think on possible issues that are going to need an overcoming solution or may be a deal breaker
- All areas of the company were near the customer, creating a customer success mentality since the beginning 
- Is a person a missionary or a mercenary: he always assess CEOs of companies that Amazon is buying to see if the CEO is truly passionated about serving customers or tackling “filthy lucre”
- The advantage of being a customer centric company is that you are able to get discomfortable very quickly by customer in the opposite of being a leader and competitor centric company that may slow down if they happen to see competitors too slow to reach them
- He thinks memos are better than slides, so it enables better understanding of the ideas shown with clarity and great thinking
- Hiring a person internal questions:
    - Will you admire this person?
    - Will this person raise the average level of effectiveness of the team?
    - Along what dimension this person might be a super star?
- Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us.
